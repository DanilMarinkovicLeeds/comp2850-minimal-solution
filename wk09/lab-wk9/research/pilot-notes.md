### Debrief Notes
**Most confusing**: "Edit failing was very confusing, I was not given an error message."
**Most helpful**: "I think the page reloading itself was very helpful when working without JS, it would have been annoying to have to reload it myself every time."
**Accessibility**: Used keyboard and mouse with javascript disabled. All features but edit working as intended. Focus visible.

### Task 4: Filter and delete tasks
**Start**: 18:22:34 → **End**: 18:22:56 = **23 seconds**
**Success**: 1 (completed)
**Errors**: 
**Confidence**: 3/5
**Observations**:
- Used filter to find all tasks as required and was not phased by reload, but was confused that the filter did not persist after deleting a task. However adapted quickly and finished the task

### Debrief Notes
**Most confusing**: "Edit failing was very confusing, I was not given an error message."
**Most helpful**: "I think the page reloading itself was very helpful when working without JS, it would have been annoying to have to reload it myself every time."
**Accessibility**: Used keyboard and mouse with javascript disabled. All features but edit working as intended. Focus visible.
