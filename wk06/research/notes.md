### Q3: “Have you ever lost track of an important task? What happened?”
**Response**:
When very busy didn't prioritise enough, wants to rank on difficulty and time to complete
**Observations**:
Rank on complexity, so don't have to write complexity in task
**Themes**:
Complexity ranking, priority
--- 
### Q4: “Do you ever work without a mouse (trackpad broken, on train)? How does that change how you interact with apps?”
**Response**:
Yes on my phone, uses touch screen. Uses trackpad when no mouse.  
**Observations**:
Application is simple, so can be used without mouse. Trackpad sufficient solution.
**Themes**:

### Q5: "Have you used a task manager with your eyes closed or in bright sunlight? What was hard?”
**Response**:
No if I could not see I would not open the app. If I had to use while visually impaired I would use a narrator.

### Q6: “If you could add one feature to make task management less stressful, what would it be?”
**Response**:
Notification system would be useful so I don't have to remember to go on the app.
**Observations**:
Notification system provides a reminder for when you're busy.
**Themes**:
Notification system
---

## Summary (Participant A)
**Top pain points**:
1. Can forget tasks if not on app so requested notification system.
2. Want ability to rank on complexity so they can better plan what to complete and when.
Without this feature they forgot to complete a task.

**Job story ideas**:
- "When busy, I want notifications so I am reminded about what I need to do."

### Q1: Last time using task manager?
**Response**: [Quote or paraphrase]
Last Saturday

**Observations**: [What stood out? Frustration? Workaround?]
It was good, but very basic. Could not edit, had to delete and create new task.
**Themes**: `[tag1]`, `[tag2]`
Editing, lightweight
---
### Q2: Biggest frustration?
**Response**: [Quote]
Not being able to edit after I commit a task.
**Observations**:[What stood out? Frustration? Workaround?]
Wants ability to edit, has to recreate tasks now to edit their information, which is frustrating.
**Themes**:
Editing
---
### Q3: “Have you ever lost track of an important task? What happened?”
**Response**:
Yes, I put down an important task, but there was no priority so I lost it.
**Observation**: 
Without ability to order tasks important tasks can be buried under less important tasks and forgotten.
**Themes**:
Priority
---
### Q4: “Do you ever work without a mouse (trackpad broken, on train)? How does that change how you interact with apps?”
**Response**:
Depends on the app, if it supports "tabbing" I'll use that to browse. If not it is difficult. 
**Observation**:
Will use a keyboard to navigate, but can struggle if keyboard navigation not properly supported.
**Themes**:
Navigation, keyboard
---
### Q5: "Have you used a task manager with your eyes closed or in bright sunlight? What was hard?”
**Response**:
Yes glare makes it hard, dark mode makes it easier.
**Observation**:
When in bright sunlight, dark mode makes app easier to use.
**Themes**:
Dark mode
---
### Q6: “If you could add one feature to make task management less stressful, what would it be?”
**Response**:
A history feature, so I can reuse previous tasks for repeating tasks. 
**Observation**:
User wants to access previous tasks and reuse them, would be good to allow editing as well so similar tasks don't need to be remade
repetitively.
**Themes**:
Editing, history

---

## Summary (Participant B)
**Top pain points**:
1. Priority is important to make sure work is not lost under new tasks.
2. History would help reduce time spent remaking similar tasks.

**Job story ideas**:
- "When I am adding a similar task to something I have already done, I want a history feature so I do not need to remake it again."

### Q1: Last time using task manager?
**Response**: [Quote or paraphrase]
3 days ago

**Observations**: [What stood out? Frustration? Workaround?]
It was easy once I got to know it, but hard to understand all the features at first.
**Themes**: `[tag1]`, `[tag2]`
Application complexity, usability
---
### Q2: Biggest frustration?
**Response**:
Doesn't take into account your energy and how complex the tasks are.
**Observations**:[What stood out? Frustration? Workaround?]
Would be good to have a way to rate how difficult tasks will be
**Themes**:
Complexity ranking, workload management
---
### Q3: “Have you ever lost track of an important task? What happened?”
**Response**:
Yes, with a long task list, it was hard to track even with priority
**Observation**:
Application had priority list, but it was not enough. Maybe a system where you could apply tags to tasks and then filter by tags
could help fix this issue.
**Themes**:
Priority, tags
### Q4: “Do you ever work without a mouse (trackpad broken, on train)? How does that change how you interact with apps?”
**Response**:
Not really, but sometimes I use arrows to navigate features and it doesn't impact it too much, just a bit more tedious.
**Observation**:
Will use keyboard to navigate, but prefers mouse and trackpad.
**Themes**:
Keyboard, navigation
### Q5: "Have you used a task manager with your eyes closed or in bright sunlight? What was hard?”
**Response**:
Not with eyes closed, but bright sunlight makes it hard to see screen so avoid using it then.
**Observation**:
Avoids using app in bright sunlight, dark mode implementation could make app better in bright settings.
**Themes**
Display, dark mode
### Q6: “If you could add one feature to make task management less stressful, what would it be?”
**Response**:
Feature that takes into account how complex tasks are, not just priority so you can complete simpler tasks when more tired.
**Observation**:
Wants ability to rank tasks by complexity as well as priority.
**Themes**:
Complexity ranking
---
## Summary (Participant C)
**Top pain points**:
1. Complexity ranking makes tasks easier to handle.
2. Dark mode helps display issues in bright settings.

**Job story ideas**:
- "When it is bright, I want a dark mode so the app is easier to see and use."
